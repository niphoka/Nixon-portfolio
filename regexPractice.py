- Ranges allow us to specify a range of characters in which we can make a match
- Shorthand character classes like \w, \d and \s represent the ranges representing word characters, digit characters, and whitespace characters, respectively
- Groupings, denoted with parentheses (), group parts of a regular expression together, and allows us to limit alternation to part of a regex
- Fixed quantifiers, represented with curly braces {}, let us indicate the exact quantity or a range of quantity of a character we wish to match
- Optional quantifiers, indicated by the question mark ?, allow us to indicate a character in a regex is optional, or can appear either 0 times or 1 time
